# DFRobot_BMP3XX
* [中文版](./README_CN.md)

This is a Library for BMP3XX, the function is to read temperature and pressure.
The BMP(390L/388) is a digital sensor with pressure and temperature measurement based on proven sensing principles. The 
sensor module is housed in an extremely compact 10-pin metal-lid LGA package with a footprint of only 2.0 × 2.0 mm² and 
max 0.8 mm package height. Its small dimensions and its low power consumption of 3.2 µA @1Hz allow the implementation 
in battery driven devices such as mobile phones, GPS modules or watches.

## Summary
* BMP(390L/388) can read temperature and pressure.
* The library supports the SPI/I2C communication.
* BMP(390L/388) also includes FIFO functionality. This greatly improves ease of use.
* Interrupts than can be used in a power efficient manner without using software algorithms.
* BMP390L is more accurate than its predecessors, covering a wide measurement range from 300 hPa to 1250 hPa.
* This new barometric pressure(BMP390L) sensor exhibits an attractive price-performance ratio coupled with low power consumption.
* Due to the built-in hardware synchronization of the sensor(BMP390L) data and its ability to synchronize data from external devices.
